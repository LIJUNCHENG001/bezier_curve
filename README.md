# Generic Bezier Curve Library #
- Generic Bezier Curve Library that supports control points of arbitary dimension numbers. (2D and 3D for normal, curvature calculations).
- Class of control point Container is built on top of Eigen Matrix; but can possibly be replaced with user-defined Point Container Class (which is quite a tedious task if starting from 0).

## Dependencies ##
- [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org)

## General Usage ##
```cpp
\\ To be added
```

## Acknowledgement ##
- This library is inspired by the following Bezier library, which supports only 2D space (as of 21st June, 2019)
